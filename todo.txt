Since im a glutten for punishment im gonna attempt to make it so you can use this mod with your mods so you can make a custom UI. I should also tell you that there is no way to make a custom UI that is not from clicking an object

--AT THE CURRENT STAGE YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO USE THE UITESTER OBJECT SO YOU CAN SEE WHATS NEW IN THE MOD
--You are able to use this with your mods now although the power is limited and it is fairly clunky. (Documentation not avaliable yet)

--When this mod is complete I will publish the source code to anyone who wishes to try and improve on this I DO NOT WANT TO BE THE ONLY ONE DOING THIS
--There will also a complete guide on how to use this for your mod so you dont need to use the source code and put it all into your mod. If you need a custom UI just download the mod and follow the guide

--Todo List
Y=Done, N=Not done, ?=WIP/Incomplete, X=Not possible/Canceled

--Base Additions //needed before I can work on most things
[Y] Sprites
[?] Objects
[Y] Persistant UI (Saves the managed UI on map reload)
[N] Current pirsoner detection (escape mode)
[X] Trailing UI (moves with your screen)
[Y] Icon system
[X] Dynamic Sizing
[X] Window names
[Y] Dynamic UI (Text can be edited on demand)
[?] less clunky UI management 

--Inputs
[N] Wait and accept (Escape mode: if it pops up you need to wait x seconds before something is accepted)
[N] Buttons (This will be using the object UI system meaning you will have to click the button and click from an array of buttons)
[N] Collision Points (Escape mode: Make it so points show up relitave to the prisoner and he selects the point he wants)

--Functions
[N] Return (so you can hook it up to return a function on your script or set a var for you)
[Y] Call (Call on an object so you can spawn a UI)
[Y] Edit (Call on an object so you can change the UI)
[Y] Relocating (Move the UI)

--Notes
You know that old meme where keemstar is screaming over rocket league? Thats gonna be me the entire project.

Thankfully it does not seem to lag the game meaning this is sort of practical
